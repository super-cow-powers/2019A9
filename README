README
This repo contains everything needed to build the project using arm-none-eabi-gcc.
Simply plug in the board, run make, then either 'make burn' or 'make gdb' to write
to the device, or debug respectively.

Using gdb with the device (simple):

Run st-util to start debugging server. 
Run 'make gdb' to start gdb.

	In GDB:
	Run 'target extended-remote :4242'.
	Run 'load' to load the code to the board.
	Run continue to run.
	Ctrl+c to interrupt (of course).
